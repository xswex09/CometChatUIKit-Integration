Prerequisites
Before installing the CometChat UI Kit for React, you must first create a CometChat application via the CometChat Dashboard. The dashboard provides all the essential chat service components, including:
- User Management
- Group Chat & Messaging
- Voice & Video Calling
- Real-time Notifications

note:
To initialize the UI Kit, you will need the following credentials from your CometChat application:
- App ID
- Auth Key
- Region
Ensure you have these details ready before proceeding with the installation and configuration.

# Register & Set Up CometChat
Follow these steps to register on CometChat and set up your development environment.

Step 1: Register on CometChat
To use CometChat UI Kit, you first need to register on the CometChat Dashboard.

üîó[Click here to Sign Up](https://app.cometchat.com/login)

Step 2: Get Your Application Keys
After registering, create a new app and retrieve your authentication details:

- Navigate to Application, then select the Credentials section.
- Note down the following keys:
  - App ID
  - Auth Key
  - Region

note:
Each CometChat application can be integrated with a single client app. Users within the same application can communicate across multiple platforms, including web and mobile.

Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment
Ensure your system meets the following prerequisites before proceeding with integration.

System Requirements:
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A code editor like Visual Studio Code or Cursor.
- npm or Yarn package manager installed.

# Getting Started
Step 1: Create a React Project
1. Open your code editor (e.g., VS Code, Cursor).
2. Initialize a new React project using one of the following methods:

Using Vite (Recommended)

npm create vite@latest my-app --template react-ts
cd my-app

Using Create React App

npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
cd my-app

3. Open the project directory in your code editor.
4. Start developing your React components inside the src directory.
5. Install additional dependencies as needed.

Step 2: Install Dependencies.

The CometChat UI Kit for React is an extension of the CometChat JavaScript SDK.
Installing it will automatically include the core Chat SDK, enabling seamless integration.

To install the CometChat UI Kit
npm install @cometchat/chat-uikit-react
yarn add @cometchat/chat-uikit-react


Step 3: Initialize CometChat UI Kit
Before using any features of the CometChat UI Kit or CometChat SDK, you must initialize the required settings. This is done using the Init method.
- Initialization Process
Call the Init method at the beginning of your application to ensure all CometChat functionalities are properly configured.

Auth Key Usage:
The Auth Key is an optional property of the UIKitSettings class. It is primarily recommended for proof-of-concept (POC) development or early-stage application development.
For secure authentication, use the Auth Token method instead.

Step 4: User Login
To authenticate a user, you need a UID. You can either:
- Create new users on the CometChat Dashboard, CometChat SDK Method or via the API.
- Use pre-generated test users:

cometchat-uid-1

cometchat-uid-2

cometchat-uid-3

cometchat-uid-4

cometchat-uid-5

The Login method returns a User object containing all relevant details of the logged-in user.

Security Best Practices: 
- The Auth Key method is recommended for proof-of-concept (POC) development and early-stage testing.
- For production environments, it is strongly advised to use an Auth Token instead of an Auth Key to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

Step 5: Choose a Chat Experience
Integrate a conversation view that suits your application's UX requirements. Below are the available options:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Conversation List + Message View
