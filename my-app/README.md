Prerequisites
Before installing the CometChat UI Kit for React, you must first create a CometChat application via the CometChat Dashboard. The dashboard provides all the essential chat service components, including:

User Management
Group Chat & Messaging
Voice & Video Calling
Real-time Notifications
note
To initialize the UI Kit, you will need the following credentials from your CometChat application:

App ID
Auth Key
Region
Ensure you have these details ready before proceeding with the installation and configuration.

Register & Set Up CometChat
Follow these steps to register on CometChat and set up your development environment.

Step 1: Register on CometChat
To use CometChat UI Kit, you first need to register on the CometChat Dashboard.

üîó Click here to Sign Up

Step 2: Get Your Application Keys
After registering, create a new app and retrieve your authentication details:

Navigate to Application, then select the Credentials section.
Note down the following keys:
App ID
Auth Key
Region
note
Each CometChat application can be integrated with a single client app. Users within the same application can communicate across multiple platforms, including web and mobile.

Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment
Ensure your system meets the following prerequisites before proceeding with integration.

System Requirements:

Node.js installed on your machine.
A code editor like Visual Studio Code or Cursor.
npm or Yarn package manager installed.

Getting Started
Step 1: Create a React Project
Open your code editor (e.g., VS Code, Cursor).
Initialize a new React project using one of the following methods:
vite
npx
Using Vite (Recommended)

npm create vite@latest my-app --template react-ts
cd my-app

Open the project directory in your code editor.
Start developing your React components inside the src directory.
Install additional dependencies as needed.
Step 2: Install Dependencies
The CometChat UI Kit for React is an extension of the CometChat JavaScript SDK.
Installing it will automatically include the core Chat SDK, enabling seamless integration.

To install the CometChat UI Kit
npm
yarn
npm install @cometchat/chat-uikit-react

Step 3: Initialize CometChat UI Kit
Before using any features of the CometChat UI Kit or CometChat SDK, you must initialize the required settings. This is done using the Init method.

Initialization Process
Call the Init method at the beginning of your application to ensure all CometChat functionalities are properly configured.

Auth Key Usage
The Auth Key is an optional property of the UIKitSettings class. It is primarily recommended for proof-of-concept (POC) development or early-stage application development.

For secure authentication, use the Auth Token method instead.

TypeScript

import { CometChatUIKit, UIKitSettingsBuilder } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react";

/**
 * CometChat Constants - Replace with your actual credentials
 */
const COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS = {
  APP_ID: "APP_ID", // Replace with your actual App ID from CometChat
  REGION: "REGION", // Replace with your App's Region
  AUTH_KEY: "AUTH_KEY", // Replace with your Auth Key (leave blank if using Auth Token)
};

/**
 * Configure the CometChat UI Kit using the UIKitSettingsBuilder.
 * This setup determines how the chat UI behaves.
 */
const UIKitSettings = new UIKitSettingsBuilder()
  .setAppId(COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS.APP_ID) // Assign the App ID
  .setRegion(COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS.REGION) // Assign the App's Region
  .setAuthKey(COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS.AUTH_KEY) // Assign the Authentication Key (if applicable)
  .subscribePresenceForAllUsers() // Enable real-time presence updates for all users
  .build(); // Build the final configuration

/**
 * Initialize the CometChat UI Kit with the configured settings.
 * Once initialized successfully, you can proceed with user authentication and chat features.
 */
CometChatUIKit.init(UIKitSettings)!
  .then(() => {
    console.log("CometChat UI Kit initialized successfully.");
    // You can now call login function to authenticate users
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("CometChat UI Kit initialization failed:", error); // Log errors if initialization fails
  });

note:
Ensure you replace the following placeholders with your actual CometChat credentials:

APP_ID ‚Üí Your CometChat App ID
AUTH_KEY ‚Üí Your CometChat Auth Key
REGION ‚Üí Your App Region
These values are required for proper authentication and seamless integration.

Step 4: User Login
To authenticate a user, you need a UID. You can either:

Create new users on the CometChat Dashboard, CometChat SDK Method or via the API.

Use pre-generated test users:

cometchat-uid-1
cometchat-uid-2
cometchat-uid-3
cometchat-uid-4
cometchat-uid-5
The Login method returns a User object containing all relevant details of the logged-in user.

Security Best Practices

The Auth Key method is recommended for proof-of-concept (POC) development and early-stage testing.
For production environments, it is strongly advised to use an Auth Token instead of an Auth Key to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

TypeScript

import { CometChatUIKit } from "@cometchat/chat-uikit-react";

const UID = "UID"; // Replace with your actual UID

CometChatUIKit.getLoggedinUser().then((user: CometChat.User | null) => {
  if (!user) {
    // If no user is logged in, proceed with login
    CometChatUIKit.login(UID)
      .then((user: CometChat.User) => {
        console.log("Login Successful:", { user });
        // Mount your app
      })
      .catch(console.log);
  } else {
    // If user is already logged in, mount your app
  }
});

Step 5: Choose a Chat Experience
Integrate a conversation view that suits your application's UX requirements. Below are the available options:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Conversation List + Message View
